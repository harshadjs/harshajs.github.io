                "body": " When I first heard of org-mode, I thought org-mode, like any other task management app, would just work out of the box and be my task management planner inside emacs. But, I was so wrong. Org-mode is so much more than that. Instead of thinking of org-mode as a \u0026#34;plug-and-play task management software\u0026#34;, one should think of org mode as a toolset for building their own personal knowledge management system.\nThere are many interesting articles on the internet about what is org-mode and how should it be used. Readers who are not familiar with org mode, should checkout org-mode\u0026#39;s official website.\nFile Organization I keep my org files in ~/org folder. The following table describes various subfolders and files in ~/org folder.\nPath Meaning ~/org/archives/ Folder containing archived org notes ~/org/projects/ Folder containing project specific notes ~/org/journal/ Folder containing journal entries ~/org/scribble.org Org file containing un-organized notes / tasks ~/org/work.org Org file containing organized work related items ~/org/personal.org Org file containing organized personal items ~/org/lists.org Org file containing various lists (such movies to watch, travel lists etc) Syncing and Backup Git is great for maintaining backup, but it\u0026#39;s not great for on-the-fly syncing across multiple devices. On the other hand, services like google-drive or dropbox are great for syncing but aren\u0026#39;t too great for backups. So, I use git for backups and google-drive for syncing. This ~/org folder is essentially a clone of a GitHub private repository and it is also configured as a folder that should continuously synchronize with a folder on Google drive.\nHowever, there\u0026#39;s one catch. Backing up your .git folder on google drive or dropbox is not a great idea. Imagine what would happen if two computers are run git commands on this folder simultaneously. Also, backing up .git on google drive / dropbox generates unnecessary upload / download traffic for google drive / dropbox. So, instead what I do is that inside ~/org folder, I created a symlink called .git which points to \u0026#34;~/dot-gits/org\u0026#34;. So, instead of backing up the entire git folder to google drive, I only backup a symlink which I can use on different computers to point to local git folders.\nThis setup allows me to backup org files on GitHub and also continuously sync them across different computers.

                "body": " Anyone who works in a field related to computer software, ends up running a bunch of CLI (command line interface) commands pretty often. The longer you stay in the field, the larger is your command set. With new systems being invented everyday, the complexity of commands being run is also increasing. Day by day, I am finding myself running more and more complex commands. That\u0026#39;s when I decided I need something to manage these commands for me. Shell history is great, but it is not portable and reliable. So, I have built pin, a portable commands organizer. Pin is available for use at https://github.com/harshadjs/pin. In this post, I\u0026#39;ll go over some of the key design choices I made while building this tool.\nPortability and the Ease of First Use I often run complex commands on resource constrained or ill configured environments which don\u0026#39;t retain any state (ephemeral VMs) or minimalstic chrooted environments - such as a custom kernel running with minimal debian image with no network configuration under qemu virtualization. This often means installing a collection of libraries and dependencies is not feasible / convenient. Therefore, the primary goals I had in my mind while designing pin were portability and the ease of first use.\nSo, given the above constraints, how does pin provide ease of first use and portability?\nPin is just one shell script that relies on very basic shell programs (such as base64 or sha1sum) for doing most of its work. Therefore, pin can be run in almost any environment where you have shell access; and given that you are trying to remember your shell commands, you … well - do have shell access.\nThis makes pin installation a very simple process. Just use wget or curl to download pin script and you are all set to use it! For environments where internet connectivity is not available (often inside qemu while testing custom kernel), you can still paste the compressed and base64 encoded version of the pin script, which gets decompressed and decoded by simple shell commands allowing you to use pin.\nSelf Identifying Objects Another design choice that I made was to store commands as files in the following format which are named as the SHA1 hash of the command (CMD) itself:\nCMD=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;base64 encoding of \u0026#34;find . -type f -iname *.[ch] | etags -\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34; DESC=\u0026#34;Generate emacs tags\u0026#34; TYPE=cmd This implies that there\u0026#39;s inherent dedpulication of all the commands stored in pin. Also, self-identification of the object prevents accidental overwrites of command files.\nOutput Caching Lastly, even though shell is very portable and requires the least number of dependencies in order to be used, it is definitely slower compared to say - a python script or a C/C++ compiled program. Since in the write path, pin mostly performs writes or updates to fixed set of files, the slowness of shell doesn\u0026#39;t affect the write path much.\nHowever, there\u0026#39;s a slight impact on the read path. For example, the pin grep command which searches for occurence of a term in the database of commands (which are base64 encoded) can be slow if the number of commands is very high. In order to deal with this problem, pin implements output caching which allows it to significantly reduce read path latencies. pin stores output of grep queries in /tmp folder. There\u0026#39;s some more work needed to maintain and perhaps configure the size of the cache, but in my experience, the number of such commands that I run in a reboot cycle has not resulted in any significant bloating of the cache.\nLinks to this note "

I presume that the build tooling doesn\u0026#39;t clean up these symlinks after they are removed and that confuses the cscope program.

                "body": " After numerous attempts at finding a cheap and easy solution to making a password protected static website, I finally have settled my mind on one! Before going over the solution let me go over the requirements that I had in my mind for the website:\nCheap Static and blog-aware Password protection on a part of the website Smooth and easy workflow to move content from private part to public Preferably, an automatic CI/CD I tried multiple solutions such as setting up Heroku dynos, CloudCanon etc. None of the solutions satisfied all the requirements until I found this option:\nGitHub + Jekyll + Makefile + AWS S3 + AWS Lambda\nLet me paint a high level picture of how the setup looks like:\nTwo GitHub Repositories Website content is split into two parts: public and private repositories. The public repository works like any other static website hosted on GitHub.\nIt contains all the jekyll build material and public posts. Private repository only contains posts that are private.\nPublic Repository Hosting The public repository gets hosted on GitHub pages as any other static website. This takes care of the public part of the website.\nSetting up private part is slightly complex but it\u0026#39;s a one-time effort. I\u0026#39;ll try to provide a high-level overview how that works.\nPassword Protection The private content is hosted in an AWS S3 bucket which only allows AWS CloudFront to read the contents. I then setup AWS Lambda that runs when a viewer tries to read content via CloudFront distribution. Here\u0026#39;s a step-by-step tutorial on how to set up S3 and CloudFront.\nBuilding Private Website In order to build the private website, we are going to need both the public and private repositories. After cloning the public repository, we create a directory named \u0026lt;public_repo\u0026gt;/_posts_private and clone the private repository in it. Yeah, we could have used git submodules. But, given that the _posts_private should point to a private repository, if we use submodules, it will break GitHub\u0026#39;s CI/CD for the public website. We don\u0026#39;t want that to break. So, we manually clone the private repository inside _posts_private folder. The magic happens inside the Makefile.\nCommand Action make _site_private Build private website make _site_public Build public website make serve_private Build and run private website locally make serve_public Build and run public website locally make sync Update private repository on S3 make clean Clean directory After running make sync, we can see that the private part of the website is published to S3/CloudFront. If you try to access it via CloudFront URL, you\u0026#39;ll see that a dialog pops up asking for your username and password.\nTying Private and Public Repositories Together Ok so we now have public part of the website working on GitHub pages and the private part of the website working on S3/CloudFront. We are now going to tie them together using a custom domain name! Domain names are pretty cheap (10-20$/yr). So, what I did was I bought this domain name and configured the DNS such that harshad.me points to the GitHub URL and personal.harshad.me points to cloudfront URL. Here\u0026#39;s how the DNS entries look:\nName Type Resolves to Comment harshad.me A 185.199.108.153 GitHub IPs 185.199.109.153 185.199.110.153 185.199.111.153 aws_verifier_key.personal CNAME aws_verifier_val.aws. personal CNAME CloudFront URL …and there you go! At the end of this, I had my public site live at - http://harshad.me and the private part of the site is live at https://personal.harshad.me!\nLinks to this note "

                "body": " I often struggled to keep chords for songs I played in a handy place. For a couple of years I have been maintaining chords in a Google Doc. Given the forgetful person that I\u0026#39;m, storing all the chords in one place has come as a blessing. Having all the chords in one place has helped me to be more organized about my music. It has helped me collaborate better with other musicians.\nHowever, using Google Docs for organizing chords has not since scaled as I added more and more songs. Besides, I was maintaining all the chords in one file. Maybe having individual files would have helped the cause but it was nowhere close to what for example UltimateGuitar provides.\nI have since migrated all the chords from the google doc onto my personal website where I write song chords in plain text format (in org-mode files) and using Hugo\u0026#39;s magic shortcodes to detect chords and present them in a way such that it is easy to follow.\nThis has worked wonders for me and this post is meant to give a high level idea of how you can use Hugo shortcodes, to organize and present chords for your songs!\nHugo Short Code for Chords I defined a new short code called chords to define the section of a post where song chords are found. What this shortcodee does is that it recognizes all the chords in its content using the following regular expression:\n[A-G][b#]?((b|maj|add|m|sus|dim|aug)*[0-9]*)*[^\\\\w] Marking Chords in Markdown I defined a new \u0026lt;chords\u0026gt; tag (note that this is not a HTML tag) as a way to indicate that all the content following this tag should be rendered as chords. This is ugly but it works for my usecase. Chords marker makes Liquid templating language use a \u0026lt;pre\u0026gt; with a CSS class for all the content that follows. As you will see in the following section, it\u0026#39;s critical that you use monospace font for rendering this =\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;=formatted text in order to maintain the mapping of where chords change according to lyrics.\n\u0026lt;chords\u0026gt; I got my first real six-string, Bought it at the five-and-dime The next step is to write chords for the songs. I first place chords just above the lyrics where the chords change and then annotate (and differentiate) chords (from lyrics) by placing them in square brackets. Square brackets encountered after \u0026lt;chords\u0026gt; tag tell Liquid templating language that these are chords and should have a special css style assigned to it.\n\u0026lt;chords\u0026gt; [D A] I got my first real six-string, Bought it at the five-and-dime Song sections (such as chorus, verse, prechorus) in the song use \u0026lt;ctag\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/ctag\u0026gt; tag.\n[D A] Jimmy quit, Joey got married, I shoulda known we\u0026#39;d never get far \u0026lt;ctag\u0026gt;Chorus\u0026lt;/ctag\u0026gt; [Bm A D G] Oh, when I look back now, That summer seemed to last forever Liquid Templating to Render Chords I then have following code in my layout file that renders chords.\nNote: In order to not confuse Liquid Templating used for this post, I have left spaces between {, } and % characters.\n{ % if page.categories contains \u0026#34;chords\u0026#34; % } { % assign var content_split = content | split:\u0026#34;\u0026lt;chords\u0026gt;\u0026#34; % } { { content_split[0] } } \u0026lt;pre class=\u0026#39;highlight\u0026#39;\u0026gt;{ { content_split[1] | replace: \u0026#34;[\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026#39;chords\u0026#39;\u0026gt;\u0026#34; | replace: \u0026#34;]\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026#34; | replace: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;chords\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026#39;highlight\u0026#39;\u0026gt;\u0026#34; | replace: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;ctag\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026#39;ctag\u0026#39;\u0026gt;\u0026#34; | replace: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/ctag\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026#34; } }\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt; { % else % } { { content } } { % endif % } JS Tricks I also have added a few Javascript tricks to implement some interesting functions such as Transpose and Auto-scroll which I first found on UltimateGuitar. These functions come very handy! For those who are interested here\u0026#39;s how the JS code for each look like. Just place these in the appropriate location (right before the { { content_split[0] } } line) in the above template.\nAuto-scroll window.scroll_state = 0; function autoscroll() { if (window.scroll_state == 0) { scroll = setInterval(function() { window.scrollBy(0, 1); console.log(\u0026#39;start\u0026#39;);}, 100); window.scroll_state = 1; } else { window.scroll_state = 0; clearInterval(scroll); console.log(\u0026#39;stop\u0026#39;); } } \u0026lt;button onclick=\u0026#34;autoscroll();\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Autoscroll\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; Transpose function transpose(direction) { var ele = document.getElementsByClassName(\u0026#39;chords\u0026#39;); // 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 // C,C#, D,D#, E, F,F#, G,G#, A,A#, B for(var i=0;i\u0026lt;ele.length;i++) { var text = ele[i].textContent; if (direction == 1) { text = text.replace(/C/g, \u0026#34;##\u0026#34;); text = text.replace(/D/g, \u0026#34;####\u0026#34;); text = text.replace(/E/g, \u0026#34;######\u0026#34;); text = text.replace(/F/g, \u0026#34;#######\u0026#34;); text = text.replace(/G/g, \u0026#34;#########\u0026#34;); text = text.replace(/A/g, \u0026#34;###########\u0026#34;); text = text.replace(/B/g, \u0026#34;#\u0026#34;); } else { text = text.replace(/C/g, \u0026#34;############\u0026#34;); text = text.replace(/D/g, \u0026#34;##\u0026#34;); text = text.replace(/E/g, \u0026#34;####\u0026#34;); text = text.replace(/F/g, \u0026#34;#####\u0026#34;); text = text.replace(/G/g, \u0026#34;#######\u0026#34;); text = text.replace(/A/g, \u0026#34;#########\u0026#34;); text = text.replace(/B/g, \u0026#34;###########\u0026#34;); } text = text.replace(/#############/g, \u0026#34;C\u0026#34;); text = text.replace(/############/g, \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;); text = text.replace(/###########/g, \u0026#34;AA\u0026#34;); text = text.replace(/##########/g, \u0026#34;A\u0026#34;); text = text.replace(/#########/g, \u0026#34;GG\u0026#34;); text = text.replace(/########/g, \u0026#34;G\u0026#34;); text = text.replace(/#######/g, \u0026#34;FF\u0026#34;); text = text.replace(/######/g, \u0026#34;F\u0026#34;); text = text.replace(/#####/g, \u0026#34;E\u0026#34;); text = text.replace(/####/g, \u0026#34;DD\u0026#34;); text = text.replace(/###/g, \u0026#34;D\u0026#34;); text = text.replace(/##/g, \u0026#34;CC\u0026#34;); text = text.replace(/#/g, \u0026#34;C\u0026#34;); text = text.replace(/AA/g, \u0026#34;A#\u0026#34;); text = text.replace(/GG/g, \u0026#34;G#\u0026#34;); text = text.replace(/FF/g, \u0026#34;F#\u0026#34;); text = text.replace(/DD/g, \u0026#34;D#\u0026#34;); text = text.replace(/CC/g, \u0026#34;C#\u0026#34;); ele[i].textContent = text; } } \u0026lt;button onclick=\u0026#34;transpose(1);\u0026#34;\u0026gt;+1\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button onclick=\u0026#34;transpose(0);\u0026#34;\u0026gt;-1\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; Have fun adding chords to your blog!

My main research interests are Networks, Internet Architecture, CCN; also I am interested in Storage, Operating Systems. Recently, I have have started loving Probability. Thanks to Prof. Mor Harchol-Balter. Advised by Prof. Peter Steenkiste, I work on a future internet architecture project called eXpressive Internet Architecture(XIA) at Carnegie Mellon.\nBefore CMU Before coming to Carnegie Mellon, I was working as a device driver developer at AirTight Networks. I worked on various 802.11 Atheros chipset drivers for Linux such as: ar5416, ar9300.\nIn my final year undergraduate project and as a part of Google Summer of Code, 2011, I worked on enhancing Ext4 file system to avail snapshotting feature. I was advised by Amir Goldstein who was the prinicipal investigator of that project.\nMusic In my free time, I play piano. I love to collaborate with musicians from various backgrounds. I currently own a YAMAHA P-105 digital piano. Please find some of my tracks (covers and compositions) on my music page.\nArch I use Arch Linux and The Arch Way is why I do it. Here is a snippet from The Arch FAQ.\nWhy would I not want to use Arch? You may not want to use Arch, if:\nafter reading The Arch Way, you disagree with the philosophy. you do not have the ability/time/desire for a \u0026#39;do-it-yourself\u0026#39; GNU/Linux distribution. you require support for an architecture other than x86_64 or i686. you take a strong stand on using a distribution which only provides free software as defined by GNU. you believe an operating system should configure itself, run out of the box, and include a complete default set of software and desktop environment on the installation media. you do not want a bleeding edge, rolling release GNU/Linux distribution. you are happy with your current OS. you want an OS that targets a different userbase. My Arch configuration is available on my GitHub repository dot-files. Links to this note "
